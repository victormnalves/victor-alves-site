I am **Victor Alves**, an economist from Brazil with strong interests in economic theory, public policy, inequality, applied econometrics, and the intersection between quantitative analysis and real-world problems.

I completed my undergraduate studies with a full scholarship at a top institution, and I am currently preparing for graduate-level research in economics. My goal is to produce work that bridges rigorous economic modeling with questions relevant to social welfare, institutions, and development.

Beyond economics, I am deeply interested in academic communication, teaching, and the democratization of knowledge through high-quality study materials.
